# README Images Instructions

To complete the README with visual elements, you'll need to create and add the following images:

## 1. FocusLock Banner (focuslock-banner.png)
Create a banner image (recommended size: 1200x400px) that represents your FocusLock application. 
The banner should include:
- The FocusLock logo/name
- A visual representation of productivity/focus
- A clean, modern design with your app's color scheme

## 2. App Screenshot (app-screenshot.png)
Take a screenshot of your application in action (recommended size: 1200x800px).
Good screenshots to include:
- The main dashboard
- The assignment creation interface
- The work mode interface
- Any other distinctive feature of your app

## Adding Images to GitHub
1. Place these images in the `/public` directory
2. Update the README.md image paths if your GitHub username or repository name differs from the placeholder

## Image Design Tips
- Use a consistent color scheme that matches your application
- Keep the design clean and professional
- Ensure text is readable
- Optimize images for web (compress without losing quality)

You can create these images using design tools like:
- Figma
- Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator
- Canva
- GIMP (free alternative)
